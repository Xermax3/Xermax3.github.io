                        Hello there! My name's <strong>Maxence Roy</strong>, also known as <strong>"Xermax"</strong> across various platforms.
                        I'm currently a college student in Computer Science at 
                        <a class="inline-link" href="http://www.johnabbott.qc.ca/" target="_blank">John Abbott College</a>,
                        Montreal, and I wish to pursue a career in software engineering.
                    </p>
                    <p id="bio-paragraph-2">
                        Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved to entertain and help the people around me.
                        I developed a passion for creating video games at a young age, and I've been programming since
                        I was 12 years old. My passion has led me to get actively involved in many online communities,
                        like the Roblox community.
                    </p>
                    <p id="bio-paragraph-3">
                        Through my successes and my failures, I have learned how to properly
                        use online resources and work independently. I've also learned how to divide an ambitious
                        assignment into efficient steps. While working on team projects, I understood the importance of
                        communicating and making the best use of each other’s skills.
                    </p>
                    <p id="bio-paragraph-4">
                        I love getting together with peers and working on awesome projects. I like to challenge
                        myself by participating in contests and game jams. As an organization freak, I always keep
                        track of what’s happening online and I reply to my messages as soon as I can. I also manage
                        the tasks I have to undertake via calendar and boards. Outside of computer science, I have
                        a passion for competitive and cooperative card / board games. I also love to compile and 
                        analyze data. For instance, I use Microsoft Excel to follow and visualize my daily tendencies.
                        From time to time, I enjoy editing videos to create entertaining compilations.
                    </p>

                <h3>Languages</h3>
                <p>
                    My first programming language was Lua, which is used to make Roblox games. Recently, 
                    I've been learning many new languages and I'm trying to make fun projects with each one.
                </p>
